### Q1 Compare different kinds of docker image families. Alpine, Slim, Stretch, Buster, Jessie, Bullseye. What does this mean? How are they different? What advantage do they provide over the others?

**Stretch - Buster - Jessie**
Images tagged with stretch, Buster, and Jessie are codenames for different Debian releases. 
|Stretch                |Buster                          |Jessie                |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|**Debian:** 9|**Debian:** 10            |**Debian:** 8            |

**Slim** 
```
Since slim image is a paired down version of the full image, 
it is generally suitable if you have space constraints,
and do not need the full version. This image generally only
installs the minimal packages needed to run the particular tool.
```

**Alpine-** 
```
Alpine images are popular for their very tiny size.
The main reason to use an Alpine image is to make your resulting
image as small as possible. The base image will be smaller than 5MB.
The python base image (adding python to the base alpine image) is currently 78.9MB.
This image is the most highly recommended if space is a concern.
The disadvantage is that it does not contain some packages that you might need.
Mainly, it uses a slimmer musl lib instead of glibc.
You may run into issues if your application has specific libc requirements.
```


### Q2 Difference between Entrypoint and CMD directive in a Dockerfile?

They both specify programs that execute when the container starts running, however;
- **CMD** commands are ignored by Daemon when there are parameters stated within the  docker run  command.
- **ENTRYPOINT** instructions are not ignored but instead are appended as command line parameters by treating those as arguments of the command.

### Q3 Explain this command written inside a Dockerfile:RUN mkdir /app/django/helloworld
```
mkdir ${path} -> Make directory 
/app/django/helloworld -> A directory made in this path, that is in currentdirectory->app->django->helloworld
```
### q4 Explain the concept of layering in Docker images/containers?
- Each layer is an image itself, just one without a human-assigned tag. They have auto-generated IDs though.
- Each layer stores the changes compared to the image it’s based on.
- An image can consist of a single layer (that’s often the case when the squash command was used).
- Each instruction in a Dockerfile results in a layer. (Except for multi-stage builds, where usually only the layers in the final image are pushed, or when an image is squashed to a single layer).
- Layers are used to avoid transferring redundant information and skip build steps which have not changed (according to the Docker cache).
